The package contains two folders:
__________________________________

1. **interaction_maps** folder contains codes for Autogeneration algorithm and uses data pertaining to ipsilateral lumbosacral region to generate, to generate spinal neurons bases muscle-muscle interactions maps i.e figure 5 presented in the manuscript  
_____________________

2. **Ia_ecxitatory**  
folder contains open_loop and close_loop folders to carryout the simulation that demonstrates the effect of Ia feeedback on the ongoing ankle angle. Figure 6 and 7 are generated using these codes.
