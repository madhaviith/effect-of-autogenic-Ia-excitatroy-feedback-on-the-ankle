Article authors : Madhav Vinodh Pithapuram, Mohan Raghavan 

__________________________________
## This package contains two folders:
__________________________________

1. **interaction_maps** folder contains codes related to autogeneration of ipslilateral lumbosacral spinal connectome and also generates spinal based muscle-muscle interactions maps in **figure 5** of the manuscript.   
__________________________________

2. **Ia_ecxitatory** folder contains open_loop and close_loop folders to carryout the simulation that demonstrates the effect of Ia feeedback on the ongoing ankle angle and mainly generates graphs presented in **figure 6 and 7** of the manuscript. 

**Note** : Please follow README.md in each of the obove folders for the list of dependencies, required softwares, installation and run instructions.
