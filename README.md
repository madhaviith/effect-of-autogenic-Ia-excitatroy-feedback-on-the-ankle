## This package contains two folders:
__________________________________

1. **interaction_maps** folder contains codes realted to autogeneration of spinal connectome and it uses the data pertaining to ipsilateral lumbosacral region(in .xlsx format) and generates spinal neuron based muscle-muscle interactions maps i.e **figure 5** presented in the manuscript.

2. **Ia_ecxitatory** folder contains open_loop and close_loop folders to carryout the simulation that demonstrates the effect of Ia feeedback on the ongoing ankle angle and mainly generates **figure 6 and 7** presented in the manuscript. 

**Note** : Please follow README.md in each of the obove folders for the list of dependencies, required softwares, installation and run instructions.
