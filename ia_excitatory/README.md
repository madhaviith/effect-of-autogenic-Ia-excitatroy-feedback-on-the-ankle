# Effect of Autogenic Ia-excitaroy feedback on the ankle Angle 
This package essentially contais two simulations folders designated as **sim_o**, **sim_c**. Each of these folders are generated by NEUIROiD platform and contained codes capable of running neuron-musculoskeletal(NEURON-OPENSIM) synchronized simulations. Although the code contents of **sim_o** and **sim_c** are same, they differ by functionality and the output data. While former folder runs open-loop simulations and later folder close-loop.
