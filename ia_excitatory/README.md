# Effect of Autogenic Ia-excitaroy feedback on the ankle Angle 
This package essentially contais two simulations folders designated as **sim_o**, **sim_c**. Each of these folders are generated by NEUIROiD platform and contained codes capable of running neuron-musculoskeletal(NEURON-OPENSIM) synchronized simulations. Although the code contents of **sim_o** and **sim_c** are same, they differ by functionality and the output data. While former folder runs open-loop simulations and later folder close-loop.

### Software and Hardware requirements

1. **Linux platform (preferably Ubuntu)**

Both code development and testing was carried out on Ubuntu-18.04.6-LTS desktop with intel-core i7 CPU and NVIDIA quadro P1000 graphics and 16GB RAM space.

2. **Python 3.7**

requied librabries: numpy, pandas, os, matplotlib, seaborn, openpyxl

libraries "opensim" and "neuron" can instaled in the steps 2 and 3

3. **OpenSim with Python3 bindings**

Install opensim version 4.x from the link: 
https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core

Confirm the installion of OpenSim with python bindings on Ubuntu by follwoing the instructions given in the link:
