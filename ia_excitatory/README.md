# Effect of Autogenic Ia-excitaroy feedback on the ankle Angle 
This package essentially contais two simulations folders designated as **sim_o**, **sim_c**. Each of these folders are generated by NEUIROiD platform and contained codes capable of running neuron-musculoskeletal(NEURON-OPENSIM) synchronized simulations. Although the code contents of **sim_o** and **sim_c** are same, they differ by functionality and the output data. While former folder runs open-loop simulations and later folder close-loop.

### Software and Hardware requirements

1. **Linux platform (preferably Ubuntu)**

Both code development and testing was carried out on Ubuntu-18.04.6-LTS desktop with intel-core i7 CPU and NVIDIA quadro P1000 graphics and 16GB RAM space. From our experince Good graphics and RAM >8GB is rquired to run the simulations  

2. **python 3.7**

requied librabries: numpy, pandas, os, matplotlib, seaborn, openpyxl

libraries "opensim" and "neuron" can instaled in the steps 2 and 3

3. **OpenSim with python3 bindings**

Install opensim version 4.x from the link: 
https://github.com/opensim-org/opensim-core

Confirm the installion of OpenSim with python bindings on Ubuntu by follwoing the instructions given in the link:
https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Scripting+in+Python

4. **NEURON with python3 bindings**

NEURON software can be installed from the link here: https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download
However the codes were tested on NEURON version 7.6. And it is prefferable to install NEURON 7.6 which can be found here: https://neuron.yale.edu/ftp/neuron/versions/v7.6/ 

Once the required version is downloaded, follow the installation instructions to **setup InterViews** and **setup NEURON with python** here: https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download/compile_linux. Also check if **python_path** is properly provided and is bound with NEURON as per the instructions provided in the same link.
